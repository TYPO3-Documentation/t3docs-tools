===========
t3doc-tools
===========

Suite of tools, mostly for bulk changes in the repositories of the TYPO3 Documentation
Team and the TYPO3 Core Team, and to output some statistics, where

* part of this is written in PHP (focused on remote actions in GitHub) and
* some of them are bash scripts (focused on local actions in the cloned repositories).

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone <url to repository>
    cd <repository folder>
    composer install

Configuration
=============

There are several repositories in

* https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation and
* https://github.com/TYPO3

which are the home of the TYPO3 Documentation Team and the TYPO3 Core Team respectively.

The names of the documentation manual repositories usually start with "TYPO3CMS-".
These can be processed specifically.

The config.yml file is used to filter out some repositories that are not yet
archived but should not be maintained any longer.

The bashScripts/config.sh file configures the local folder of the cloned repositories,
which is generated-data/repos/ by default. The settings can be overridden with a custom
bashScripts/config.local.sh file.

The local repositories of each GitHub user namespace (currently "typo3-documentation" and "typo3")
are cloned into local subfolders following the pattern generated-data/repos/<user>,
i.e. currently into

* generated-data/repos/typo3-documentation/ and
* generated-data/repos/typo3/,

â€“ for separate and general processing.

Usage: PHP
==========

The PHP scripts are located in the project root folder.
