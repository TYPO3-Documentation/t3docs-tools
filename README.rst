============
t3docs-tools
============

Suite of tools, mostly for bulk changes in the repositories of the TYPO3 Documentation
Team and the TYPO3 Core Team, and to output some statistics, where

* part of this is written in PHP (focused on remote actions in GitHub) and
* some of them are bash scripts (focused on local actions in the cloned repositories).

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone <url to repository>
    cd <repository folder>
    composer install

Configuration
=============

There are several repositories in

* https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation and
* https://github.com/TYPO3 and
* https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3

which are the home of the TYPO3 Documentation Team, the TYPO3 Core Team and the
Friends of TYPO3 respectively.

The names of the documentation manual repositories usually start with "TYPO3CMS-".
These can be processed specifically.

The config.yml file is used to filter out some repositories that are not yet
archived but should not be maintained any longer. The official, version controlled
configuration can be overridden with a custom, non version controlled
config.local.yml file.

The bash/config.sh file configures the local folder of the cloned repositories,
which is generated-data/repos/ by default. The settings can be overridden with a custom
bash/config.local.sh file.

The local repositories of each GitHub user namespace (officially "friendsoftypo3",
"typo3" and "typo3-documentation") are cloned into local subfolders following
the pattern generated-data/repos/<user>, i.e. currently into

* generated-data/repos/typo3-documentation/ and
* generated-data/repos/typo3/ and
* generated-data/repos/friendsoftypo3/,

â€“ for separate and general processing. Additional user namespaces can be defined
in the config.yml and config.local.yml already mentioned.

Usage: PHP
==========

The PHP scripts are located in the project root folder.
